# DL-project

The project defines two models a baseline CNN model and transformer model based on GPT which we train on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

The CNN_baseline_CIFAR-10 notebook contains the baseline model.
The imgtrnsfrmr notebook consists of the transformer model code and imggpt module defines the model and trainer for the transformer model.
